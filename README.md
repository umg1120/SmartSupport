# Smart Support

A full-stack web application that automates support ticket handling using AI. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it uses Google Gemini to analyze tickets and extract key details like type, priority, required skills, and helpful notes. Based on this analysis, the system automatically assigns tickets to the most suitable moderator or the admin if no match is found. It features a role-based user system with Users, Moderators, and Admins.
